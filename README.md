# Image-Classification-of-CIFAR-10-using-ANN-CNN
**The CIFAR-10 dataset**
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
Here are the classes in the dataset:
airplane,										
automobile,										
bird,									
cat,									
deer,										
dog,										
frog,										
horse,										
ship,										
truck,
•Initailly used  an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** with fully connected layers for image classification. It compares the performance of different optimizers by plotting accuracy and loss curves.
•Then used **CNN** with different optimizers.Visualised the model accuracy for all models by making confusion matrix using Tensorflow and heatmap using seaborn library
